# Let's Learn Thai!

This repository supports my journey trying to learn to read and speak Thai.

I expect to proceed by building vocabulary sheets for verbs, nouns, etc. to
help build the memory of the words as I learn them.  Similarly, I expect to
produce a hint sheet for phrases I use while learning.

The plan is to master reading the alphabet, to better understand the tones,
while watching starter learn-Thai videos on YouTube where the words are written
in both Thai and English, to reinforce learning the alphabet; picking up any
vocabulary at this stage will be a bonus, as the goal is to get fluent reading
Thai scripts.
